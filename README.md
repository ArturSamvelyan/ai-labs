# Artificial Intelligence laboratory works:
1) **Genetic Algorithm**: solving the traveling salesman problem using genetic
algorithms.
2) **Hopfield Net**: implementing Hopfield Neural Net from scratch in python and
signal (image) recovering using it.
3) **Recommender system**: implementing binary tree recommender system which
predicts a disease using the symtomps are given.
